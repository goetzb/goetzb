### Hi 👋

When not writing text or code for [Strand Writing & Design](https://strand-uk.com/), I'm  building [UnscrewMe](https://www.unscrewme.co.uk/) 🍾 and tasting wine 🍷 (WSET Level 3).

Other interests include coffee ☕️, food 🍽, words 📔, languages 🇬🇧🇸🇪🇩🇪, Python 🐍, Django 🦄 , Vue.js 🖥 and Startups 🚀.

For the past ten years, I've been living in London, UK.

You can also find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/goetzb) or [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/goetz).
